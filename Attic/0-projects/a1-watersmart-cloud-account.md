- Chesapeake Bay Studies investigated how USGS Cloud Hosting Solutions (CHS) could enable more efficient data sharing 
    - among science teams and provide 21st century science capabilities. 
    - showed the readiness and support for moving their science to the Cloud. 
    - It takes significant effort and planning to adopt the Cloud.

- Critical Factors
    - identification of a CHS Point of Contact and 
    - establishing a sustainable Cost Center Cloud account and funding structure.
    - complete buy-in by science team(s)
    - understand access methods
    - ingress and egress methods and costs [tony]
    
    
### CHS Custom Environment
- at least one dedicated account -
- secured funding
- identify a POC

    

## CHS POC Notes
- Should understand AWS "best practices"
- submit help requests to the CHS team
    - ET needed very few of these
        - just ec2 docker ships 
        - and apublic bucket (requester pays)
- Overall, the account POC needs to be a highly technical staff member 
    - with a strong IT background.
- An account POC will be responsible for the annual **Assessment and Authorization** (A&A) system reporting.
    - maybe we could plagerize here
    - or scale the cloud effort , join forces etc ... TBD
- Cloud resources need to be tightly regulated by the account POC 
    - so that cost is predictable and 
    - does not exceed the dedicated budget.
    - requent communication with science teamsâ€“to understand 
        - specific requirements and 
        - implement resource management processes.

-CHS recommends taking a staggered implementation approach when getting started with cloud-based science
    - ultimately requires significant staff and funding resources over time. (Depends on how talented the staff is :-) )
        - Choosing a few projects that show readiness for cloud adoption 
        - and piloting these projects is the first step.
