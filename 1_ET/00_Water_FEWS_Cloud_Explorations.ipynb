    "    “Science, not operations. Changing, not fixed. And the world, not local. We want to get to a flexible computing platform that lets us pay only for what we use, but lets us use whatever we want. Lets us experiment, lets us scale, lets us not wait in queues, and lets us do our research as efficiently and effectively as we can. And a platform where we can join other agencies and partners from around the world to share data, tools and approaches to help understand and protect our planet. This is what the Cloud has to offer.” – Rob Thieler, Center Director, USGS WHCMSC, remarks delivered at the NHMA Fall 2020 meeting\n",

    "    - You can get virtually unlimited amounts of storage space for free or cheap.\n",
    "- ### Access files anywhere: \n",
    "    - You can easily access and synchronize your data from multiple devices anywhere in the world.\n",
    "- ### Share and collaborate: \n",
    "    - It's easy to share your information with others and control permissions to view or edit files.\n",
