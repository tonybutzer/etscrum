# Success Filtering
- Validate your hypotheses by speaking with real customers.
- **Excellence is about making the best decisions - Aristotle**
- Efficiency leads to more time for excellent decisions
- Finding ideas most people donâ€™t know about, or agree with, is key to being successful.

# Reduce Data Wrangling
- **ARD in the cloud**
- COGS
- STAC
- Develop tools, notebooks and libraries
- encourage the use of reusable data
- reduce replication

# Reduce the amount of coding
- **zero in on python**
- improve the python science libraries
    - make them more powerful
    - make them cooperate as ecosystems
- **Xarray, rasterio - ecosystems -plotting included**
    - go between geotiffs and netcdfs - with a single line of code
- don't apologise for using command line tools - ex. rio cogeo; rio window/chop
- COG
- numpy
        
# Reduce Metawork
> "Time is money. Remove things that reduce your effectiveness at the job." - Tim Ferris
- **simple solutions**
    - bash versus kubernetes
    - MARKDOWN - it works across your project steps.
- work from home
- communicate using teams 
- **repeatable technologies**
    - git
    - docker
- agile processes - focus on outcomes and customers
    - manage the queue - be careful with estimates - they usually don't work here
- **SELF DOCUMENTING TECHNOLOGIES**
    - Makefiles & Dockerfiles
    - jupyter
    - well written Python code
    - git
- training sessions with repetition
- **Everything as CODE**
    - infrastructure
    - operations
- **don't fear disruptive technologies!**
- listen to youtube at 2x speed - waste time efficiently :-)
        
# How we got started -- ET incubation
1. Attended Pangeo School together
2. Open Data Cube and Pangeo are solutions waiting for a problem
3. I offered to help scientists use Pangeo and Xarray
4. **The ET folks and Sanath from fireScience approached me**
    - simple animations and the power of xarray
    - had a meeting with the ET stakeholders
        - they had success in the cloud with Google Earth Engine
        - they had audacious goals for VegET
        
 
 # Next Steps
 1. Establish a CHS/AWS space for the WaterSMART (Agro-Hydro-Applications) AHA Program
     - **move from prototype - proof of concept - ET test case**
     - move to production
 2. Optimizations
     - Use AWS batch for Mosaic Code - embarassingly parallel
     - wrangle - then optimize for cloud - then exploit the optimizations
 3. More XARRAY stuff
     - Zarr
     - Dask
 4. **Visualization Improvements**
     - plotly/dash - dashboards
         - port University of Colorado phenology dashboard from Heroku to CHS/AWS
     - Explore holoviews optimizations
     - Other Visualizations
 5. Figure out ARC in the Cloud!
 6. **Mitigate the "Trapped in the Cloud Phenom"**

- Chesapeake Bay Studies investigated how USGS Cloud Hosting Solutions (CHS) could enable more efficient data sharing 
    - among science teams and provide 21st century science capabilities. 
    - showed the readiness and support for moving their science to the Cloud. 
    - **It takes significant effort and planning to adopt the Cloud.**

- Critical Factors
    - identification of a CHS Point of Contact and 
    - establishing a sustainable Cost Center Cloud account and funding structure.
    - **complete buy-in by science team(s)**
    - understand access methods
    - **ingress and egress methods and cost** [tony]
    
By far, the majority indicated that they had some skills but **would like more training.**
    - we used real time - just in time training for ET

- The Cloud offers unbound possibilities but requires thoughtful planning to stay within the available budget resources.
